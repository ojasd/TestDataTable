# XM Code Challenge

This code challenge is an opportunity to demonstrate your knowledge of Angular2+ and solid web development patterns. This repo contains a skeleton Angular 5 app with Bootstrap 3 styling.

## Your challenge

Fetch a list of users from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users and display them in a table.

### Requirements
- The table should inclcude their full name, contact info (email, address, and phone number) and company name.
- Please put the company name in ALL CAPS.
- Please only display the first five digits of the zipcode.
- Do not show any users who have a phone number with an extension (e.g., phone number ending in x1234)
- Clicking on the "Full Name" header in the table should sort the users by last name from A-Z. Clicking on it again should sort by last name from Z-A.

## Please do:

- Create a service to manage fetching and parsing the data
- Use ES6/Typescript classes to model any data structures

## Please don't:

- Add any more npm packages, libraries, or plugins
- Worry about routing. A single Angular page is fine.
